Task 2 - Unsupervised Machine Learning
Task-2 This task is given by The Sparks Foundation in Graduate Rotational Internship Program.

K-Means Clustering
In this Unsupervised ML task, we are given iris dataset. For performing ML algorithm, we have to assume the dataset without labels and then predict the optimum number of clusters. For this Unsupervised ML task, I have chosen 'K-Means clustering' algorithm.

Task Objective : From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
About Iris Dataset:

Iris flower data set was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. Iris data set gives the measurements in centimetres of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

There are 4 features:

sepalLength: sepal length in cm
sepalWidth: sepal width in cm
petalLength: petal length in cm
petalWidth: petal width in cm
There are 3 classes representing class label of iris flower species

Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolour
Iris Virginica
